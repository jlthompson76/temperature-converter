### Rewrite Temperature Conversion app

Use your own temperature conversion code as a starting point to rewrite it using best practices and functions.

Tips:

* Where should the JavaScript be located?
* Should you be using let, var, or const?
* How many functions should you have? How many actions/things is your app doing?
* Each function should only have 1 task.
